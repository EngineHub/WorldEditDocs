Want to see selection lines?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To see lines showing your selection, you can either:

1. Access a limited version of the selection outlines server-side via the ``//drawsel`` command. It works only for cuboid selections that are not larger than 32x32x32, and you have to be in creative mode. These limitations are due to how structure blocks have worked in Minecraft for a long time.

2. Use a third party client-side mod, e.g. `WorldEditCUI Forge Edition 3 <https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/worldeditcui-forge-edition-3>`_ (for Forge, obviously) or `WorldEdit CUI <https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/worldeditcui-fabric>`_ (for Fabric). Note that these mods require either Forge or Fabric, so you will have to install one of them at first.

.. note::
    If you would like to use a really old version of Minecraft (1.8 or earlier), in addition to downloading an older WorldEdit (version 6), you will also need the old `WorldEditCUI mod by Mumfrey <https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1292886-worldeditcui>`_. Note that this mod requires LiteLoader (installation instructions on that page) instead.
