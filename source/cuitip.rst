Want to see selection lines?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To see lines showing your selection, you can either:

1. Access a limited version of the selection outlines server-side via the ``//drawsel`` command. It works only for cuboid selections that are not larger than 32x32x32, and you have to be in creative mode. These limitations are due to how structure blocks have worked in Minecraft for a long time.

2. Use a third party client-side mod, e.g. `WorldEdit CUI (Fabric) <https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/worldeditcui-fabric>`_. Note that this mod requires Fabric, so you will have to install it at first.

.. note::
    If you would like to use an older version of Minecraft (1.12 or earlier), in addition to downloading an older WorldEdit (version 6), you may also need the old `WorldEditCUI mod by Mumfrey <https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1292886-worldeditcui>`_. Note that this mod requires LiteLoader (installation instructions on that page) instead.
