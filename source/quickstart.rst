Quick Start
===========

First things first
==================

* If you are using Bukkit, then you need to have permissions to use WorldEdit. You can give yourself op (``/op yourname``) to give yourself permissions. Sponge servers will also need to use permissions, though Sponge does not use op to grant all permissions.
* If you are using Forge/Fabric and playing single player, then WorldEdit is only enabled if your world has cheats enabled.
* If you are using Forge/Fabric server, then only ops can use WorldEdit.

.. tip:: For Forge/Fabric, you can:

    * Turn on "cheat-mode" in WorldEdit's settings (see :doc:`config`) file to let you use WorldEdit even in survival (and on a server, everyone is allowed)
    * Or instead, turn on "use-in-creative" to let yourself use WorldEdit when you have creative mode (and on a server, when someone has creative)

.. include:: cuitip.rst

The selection lines mod works regardless of how you may have installed WorldEdit (on a Bukkit server, on singleplayer, etc).

Getting Around
==============

First, let's figure out how you can get around quickly.

    1. Look at a block not too far away and type ``/jumpto``
    2. Stand under a tree and type ``/ascend``
    3. While on top of the tree, type ``/descend``
    4. Stand behind a tree trunk, look straight ahead, make sure there's room on the other side, and type ``/thru``

Or whip out your compass (or type ``//wand -n``), look at a nearby block, and left click. Want to go through walls? Right click on a wall.

Making Selections
=================

A cuboid is like 3D rectangle. In WorldEdit, you select the region that you want by setting two points of a cuboid.

.. image:: /images/cuboid.png
    :align: center

How do you choose the two points? You can either:

    * Left and right click blocks while holding a wooden axe (use ``//wand`` to get a wooden axe)
    * Stand somewhere and type ``//pos1`` and ``//pos2``
    * Look at a block and type ``//hpos1`` and ``//hpos2``

**Tutorial:** Make an approximate selection of a 15x15x15 area to test with and go to the next section.

Doing things with the selection
======================================================

    1. Set the entire thing to bedrock: ``//set minecraft:bedrock`` (``minecraft`` is implicit. If you're playing on a platform with mods, you'll need the mod's namespace to identify blocks, eg ``//set ic2:stone``.)
    2. Set the entire thing to stone: ``//set 1`` (these are legacy IDs used in Minecraft 1.12 and before. You can use them if you know them already, but it's recommended (and easier) to learn the names of blocks - new blocks in 1.13+ don't have these ids!)
    3. Set the selection to 50% sandstone, 50% glass: ``//set sandstone,glass``
    4. Replace the sandstone with dirt: ``//replace sandstone dirt``
    5. Clear the area: ``//set air``
    6. Generate an interesting shape: ``//g 35 data=(32+15/2/pi*atan2(x,y))%16; (0.75-sqrt(x^2+y^2))^2+z^2<0.25^2``
    7. Look in a cardinal direction (not diagonal) and repeat your selection: ``//stack 4``

Let's undo your changes!

    * Undo 7 times: ``//undo 7``

Adjusting the selection
=======================

So you've got a cuboid. Let's change it!

    1. Make the cuboid 10 blocks taller, going up: ``//expand 10 up``
    2. Make the cuboid 5 blocks longer in the direction that you are looking: ``//expand 5``
    3. Make the cuboid 10 blocks shorter, going down: ``//contract 10 down``

Playing with brushes
====================

    1. Grab a pickaxe (or any item of choice) and have it as your active slot.
    2. Turn on a stone brush of radius 5: ``/br sphere stone 5``
    3. Aim at ground not near you and right click to place large stone spheres.
    4. Make it so the brush only affects grass: ``/mask grass``
    5. Instead of placing stone, let's place wool: ``/material red_wool,green_wool``
    6. Right click more areas.
    7. Disable the brush: ``/brush none``
